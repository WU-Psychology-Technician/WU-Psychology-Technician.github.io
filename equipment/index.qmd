# Equipment and Facilities

The Psychology Department at Wrexham University has a wide range of
specialist equipment to support teaching, research, and student
projects. Our technicians provide training, setup, and ongoing support
to ensure equipment is used safely and effectively.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Available Equipment

-   [**Tobii Pro Spark Eye
    Trackers**](https://www.tobii.com/products/eye-trackers/screen-based/tobii-pro-spark)\
    Portable, user-friendly devices for high-quality eye-tracking
    research. Suitable for projects in attention, cognition, and visual
    behaviour.

-   [**Biopac Systems**](https://www.biopac.com/)\
    A comprehensive suite for recording physiological signals such as
    EDA (electrodermal activity), ECG (electrocardiogram), EMG
    (electromyogram), and respiration. Ideal for psychophysiology and
    health psychology studies.

-   [**BioRadio**](https://www.glneurotech.com/products/bioradio/)\
    Wireless physiological data acquisition system, particularly useful
    for mobility studies and projects requiring real-time bio-signal
    monitoring.

-   [**CANTAB**](https://cambridgecognition.com/digital-cognitive-assessments/)
    **(Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery)**\
    A widely used computerized system for assessing cognitive functions
    such as memory, attention, and executive function.

-   **Virtual Reality Equipment**\
    VR headsets and software support for immerse experimental paradigms
    using the [Unity Experimental
    Framework](https://github.com/immersivecognition/unity-experiment-framework).
    Useful in applied psychology, perception studies, and innovative
    research designs.

-   **High-Quality Audio-Visual Recording**\
    Digital cameras, microphones, and editing tools for experimental
    recording, behavioural coding, and presentation material.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Specialist Skills

The Psychology technicians are trained in the latest, simulation
training

-   **VR/AR/XR Implementations** Designing and delivering immersive
    experiences using Virtual, Augmented, and Extended Reality to
    simulate real-world environments for teaching, training, and
    research purposes.

-   **Immersive Simulation & Scenario-Based Learning** Developing
    tailored scenarios and role-play environments that allow students to
    experience, practice, and reflect on psychological concepts and
    professional skills in safe, controlled conditions.

-   **Immersive Studio Toolkit** Applying advanced studio tools and
    platforms to create high-quality, interactive content that
    integrates seamlessly into teaching and experimental setups.

-   **Interactive Wearables & Portable Technology** Utilizing wearable
    devices (such as biometric sensors, VR headsets, and mobile-based
    platforms) to gather real-time physiological and behavioral data,
    supporting innovative psychological research.

-   **3D Scanning, Photogrammetry & Digital Twins** Capturing physical
    environments and objects to build digital replicas, enabling highly
    accurate reconstructions for analysis, training, or experimental
    immersion.

-   **Motion Capture for Immersive Performance & Interaction**
    Implementing motion capture systems to study movement, behavior, and
    interaction in both research and applied contexts, bringing realism
    and precision into immersive simulations. ---

## Booking and Training

-   Equipment can only be booked in advance via the [Psychology
    Technicians](https://wu-psychology-technician.github.io/) with prior
    approval from your supervisor.\
-   Training is provided where specialist knowledge is required (e.g.,
    ECG, EDA, Eye Tracking).\
-   Students are encouraged to discuss project needs early so we can
    plan suitable training and ensure availability of equipment.
