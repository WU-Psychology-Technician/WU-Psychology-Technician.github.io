# Background Information

-   The **Short Dark Triad (SD3)** is a 27-item self-report questionnaire developed by **Jones & Paulhus (2014)** to efficiently measure three socially aversive personality traits—**Machiavellianism, Narcissism, and Psychopathy**—in non-clinical populations. The SD3 was created to provide a **brief, reliable, and valid** alternative to longer or more clinical assessment tools, making it suitable for research settings where time is limited.
