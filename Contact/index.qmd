## Guidance for Enquiries

-   **Students** â€“ Please contact us as early as possible if you require technical support for third-year projects, dissertations, or research activities. Early discussions allow us to plan effectively and ensure you have the right equipment and training in place.

-   **Academic Staff** â€“ We are available to support teaching, laboratory practicals, open days, and research projects. If your module or event requires technical input, please reach out in advance so we can coordinate.

-   **External Enquiries / Third Parties** â€“ All requests relating to collaborations, equipment demonstrations, or technical support for external projects should also be directed to the email above. We will respond or redirect your enquiry as appropriate.

## Contacting Externally

For reasons of academic integrity and operational efficiency, we kindly ask that all requests â€” whether for student projects, staff teaching support, or third-party collaborations â€” be directed through our main contact email. This ensures enquiries are handled promptly, consistently, and recorded appropriately.
