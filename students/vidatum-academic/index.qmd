This document was created by the psychology technicians residing in the Psychology department at Wrexham University with support from AI (Copilot‑GPT‑5, February 2026).

# **1-Project Details**

This section will be covering the first section of your ethics application which is the *Project Details*.

## *1-1-Project*

This section is straightforward. Add the necessary basic details such as

-   Project title

-   Your name :)

-   Are you:

    -   Undergraduate student (BSc)

    -   Postgraduate Taught Student (MSc)

    -   Postgraduate Research Student (MPhil, MRes, PhD)

-   **Programme**

    -   BSc (Hons) Psychology

    -   MSc Applied Psychology

    -   MSc Psychology (Conversion)

-   Your supervisor's name - (You will have to search for their name).

-   Supervisor's Faculty - **Faculty of Social and Life Sciences**.\

## *1-2-Project Dates*

Make sure to set your **Project Start Date** *before* you submit your ethics application. Many students overlook the two‑week review period, and applications are often returned for small corrections such as incorrect dates. To avoid delays, ensure your start date allows enough time for the review process.

For the **Project End Date**, give yourself the *maximum* amount of time possible. Think about your dissertation deadline and set your end date to at least **2–4 weeks before** your final submission to ensure you have enough time for data collection, analysis, and writing.

## *1-3-Funding*

This is another straightforward section, as your dissertation research should not require any funding.

## *1-4-Generic Application*

Another straightforward section — this should simply be a **“no.”**

## *1-5-External Approval*

Another straightforward section — this should simply be a **“no.”** However, students would only need **External Approval** if their research involves an organisation, setting, or participant group **outside the University**, where that organisation has its *own* ethics or permission procedures. Examples include:

-   **Schools or Colleges** — Many schools require their own safeguarding and research approval before any contact with pupils or staff.

<!-- -->

-   **NHS settings** — Any research involving patients, staff, data, or premises within the NHS requires approval through the Health Research Authority (HRA).

<!-- -->

-   **Charities, workplaces, or community organisations** — If you intend to recruit participants or collect data through an external organisation, they may have internal research governance processes you must follow.

<!-- -->

-   **Private companies or clinical services** — Some services (e.g., counselling agencies, private clinics) require written permission or internal ethical review.

In short, a student needs **External Approval** whenever another organisation acts as a gatekeeper to participants, data, or locations, and that organisation insists on its own permission procedure.

## *1-6-Application type*

Most of the time this should only consist of [**Human Participants**]{.underline}. Frequently asked is whether you are collecting **personal data**, but since you are following BPS guidelines then you will be **anonimising the data and therefore not collecting personal data**. If you are collecting neuro-endocrinological, bloord, or any other data for biological data analysis then this would be **human material.**

# **2-Aims & Objectives**

This section will be covering the second section of your ethics application which is the *Aims and Objectives*. This will vary for each student and therefore the guidance below provides **general advice** to help you structure and express your aims effectively.

## *2-1-Research Aims*

Provide your research aims and objectives of your dissertation project.

-   In this section, clearly state **what your dissertation project intends to achieve**.\
    Your **aim** should give an overall statement of the purpose of your study, while your **objectives** should break this down into specific, achievable steps. These must align with your research question and the methods you intend to use.

Please provide details of your research design(Please use lay language free from technical terms) 

-   Next, briefly outline **how** you plan to conduct your research. This may include your methodology (e.g., experimental, survey, qualitative interviews), sampling approach, data‑collection techniques, and any key procedures. Keep this section concise but clear enough for reviewers to understand your planned process.

Describe the potential benefits and impacts of your research, this can involve improving our current knowledge of the literature, how to improve a service etc.

-   Here, explain how your research may be valuable. Potential benefits might include:

    -   Contributing to or updating existing psychological literature

    -   Highlighting gaps in current knowledge

    -   Informing practice or improving a service

    -   Providing insights that could guide future research or interventions

You do *not* need to guarantee outcomes—simply outline the possible positive contributions your work may offer.

## *2-2-Gatekeeper*

If you are requesting permission to access an individual or a group of potential research participants through an external organisation, you **must select “Yes”** for this question. This applies whenever an organisation, gatekeeper, or authorised person is required to grant you access.

Please also speak with your supervisor, as some organisations are classed as **higher‑risk** for ethical review. These may require additional scrutiny, longer approval times, or further documentation before your application can be approved.

## *2-3-Risk*

Please refer back to the **BPS Ethical Principles** to guide how you will minimise risks within your study. You can access the full [BPS Code of ethics and conduct](https://www.bps.org.uk/guideline/code-ethics-and-conduct) on the BPS website.

Nonetheless, the primary ethical principles include:

-   **Respect** – valuing the dignity, rights, and autonomy of all participants.

-   **Competence** – working within your abilities and seeking supervision where necessary.

-   **Responsibility** – ensuring participant welfare, avoiding harm, and managing risk appropriately.

-   **Integrity** – conducting research honestly, transparently, and without deception unless ethically justified.

## *2-4-Method*

-   **Interviews -** 1-to-1 interviews between the participant (interviewee) and yourself (the interviewer)

-   **Focus Groups -** thematic discussions between participants.

-   **Survey / Questionnaire** - Psychometric questionnaires

-   **Observation** - Observation to obtain inter-rater scoring.

-   **Non-Invasive experiment** - Most psychological / cognitive experiments would be considered as this.

-   **Invasive experiment** - This can suggest several things. The one that can be attributed mostly for this high-stress psychological experiments or invasive electrode placements.

-   **Secondary Analysis** - You should only do secondary analysis if you are doing a quantitative analysis of the data, such as meta-analysis or a meta synthesis. Therefore this excludes systematic reviews or analyses of previous qualitative research.

-   **Human Tissue** – Collecting, storing, or analysing biological samples (e.g., blood, saliva, DNA) to investigate physiological, genetic, or health-related research questions.

-   **Audits / Service Evaluations taking place in the NHS** – Assessing existing healthcare services or practices to determine effectiveness, quality, or compliance with standards, rather than generating new generalisable research knowledge.

-   **Internet-mediated research / data mining** – Collecting or analysing data gathered through online platforms, social media, forums, digital archives, or large datasets to explore behaviours, attitudes, or trends.

-   **Animals** – Conducting research involving live animals to study behaviour, biology, or physiological processes under controlled or observational conditions.

-   **Environmental Methods** – Investigating how physical or social environments influence behaviour, wellbeing, or health (e.g., noise, space design, natural vs urban settings).

-   **Visual / Audio Methods** – Using images, video, sound recordings, or multimedia materials as primary data sources to analyse behaviour, communication, or experiences.

-   **Auto-ethnography** – A reflective research approach where researchers use their own personal experiences as data to explore cultural, social, or psychological phenomena.

-   **Other** – Research methods that do not fit into the listed categories and require further explanation or justification within the research proposal.

# **3 - Data Management**

This section will be covering the third section of your ethics application which is the *Data Management*. This will vary for each applicant and therefore I will be providing general advice.

## *3-1-Data Type*

You have two sections to fill out here; what the data is and how will the data be collected. Just be as pedantic as possible and try to give as much information out as possible so that the reviewer understand what you are trying to do. Sometimes being vague can be at your disadvantage as then the reviewer will question if there's any ethical considerations you had left out in your application as data is important. S

Specifically to consider, you must highlight why you are collecting specific demographic data. As the are protected characteristics that must be protected unless past research demands it. **Essentially, protected characteristics are personal identity attributes that require extra care in research because misuse or disclosure could cause harm, discrimination, or distress.** Therefore, if you are trying to obtain specific demographics then *please make sure to reference* why it is *necessary* for your research to obtain these characteristics in alignment to your **aims and objectives**.

A list of common protected characteristics relevant to psychological research:

-   **Age** – Including children, adolescents, and older adults, who may require additional consent or capacity considerations.
-   **Disability** – Physical, sensory, cognitive, or mental impairments; includes neurodiversity and mental health conditions.
-   **Gender reassignment** – Transgender and gender-diverse identities, including transition history.
-   **Marriage and civil partnership** – Relevant when research concerns legal, social, or relational status.
-   **Pregnancy and maternity** – Including pregnancy status, postnatal experiences, or fertility-related issues.
-   **Race / ethnicity** – Including nationality, skin colour, ethnic or cultural background.
-   **Religion or belief** – Religious affiliation, spiritual beliefs, or lack of belief.
-   **Sex** – Typically referring to biological sex.
-   **Sexual orientation** – Sexual identity, attraction, or behaviour.

Ethics committees should and will often ask:

-   Is this characteristic essential to the research aims?

-   Could participants be identified or harmed if data were disclosed?

-   Are recruitment, consent, and reporting respectful and inclusive?

You must clearly describe how your data will be collected or generated. In most cases, data should be collected using approved platforms such as **JISC** (for surveys), **Gorilla.sc** (for experimental tasks), **Panopto** (for interviews / focus groups). If you are collecting data in person without using a dedicated platform, you must outline a clear and structured procedure to ensure that data are collected consistently, handled securely, and stored appropriately on **University One Drive**.

If your study involves any **paper-based materials**, you must specify how these will be managed and securely disposed of, including prompt placement into **confidential waste bins** once data have been transferred or are no longer required. Careful consideration of these procedures is essential, as **face-to-face data collection is subject to closer ethical scrutiny**, particularly in relation to how participant data are handled, stored, and protected.

## *3-2-Data Storage*

Wrexham University recommends that all research data should be stored on the University server or your university Office 365 accounts as a secure protected and backed up service. Any physical data should be stored securely on University site. Further guidance on the safe storage of research data can be found on the [UK Data Service Webpages](https://ukdataservice.ac.uk/learning-hub/research-data-management/#store-your-data).

## *3-3-Access*

In this section, you must specify who will have access to the data for the duration of the research project. Access should normally be restricted to you as the student researcher and your supervisor. If your project is advanced in nature or may require technical or methodological support, you should also include **psychology technicians** as authorised data handlers within the application. Limiting access to only those directly involved in the research helps ensure confidentiality, data security, and compliance with ethical and data protection requirements.

## *3-4-Retention & Destruction*

Student research data should be stored until the end of studies or transferred to the supervisor if required to be retained for a longer period. If required for longer, then necessary data to support or validate a research project’s observations, findings or outputs should be retained in an appropriate format and storage facility for at least 10 years

## *3-5-Open Access*

If you are attempting to make your data available for re-use then please speak to your supervisor.

## *3-6-Dissemination*

In this section, you should explain where and how your findings will be shared. For most undergraduate and postgraduate projects, this will include:

Submission as part of a dissertation, thesis, or assessed coursework

Presentation to academic staff or examiners

Possible inclusion in poster presentations, internal conferences, or teaching materials

If there is any intention to share findings more widely (e.g. conferences, journal articles, public reports), this should be stated clearly. You should also indicate that results will be reported in an aggregated and anonymised form, rather than at an individual participant level.

Students are not expected to publish their work, but they should be clear and realistic about potential academic dissemination routes. If you seek to publish your work then please speak to your supervisor.

Something to note however, you should demonstrate awareness of how dissemination could affect participants or groups represented in the data. Key ethical considerations typically include:

-   Anonymity and confidentiality – ensuring that no individual participant can be identified in written reports, presentations, or figures.
-   Sensitive or protected characteristics – taking care not to stigmatise, stereotype, or misrepresent individuals or groups, particularly where protected characteristics are involved.
-   Responsible reporting – avoiding sensationalised language, overgeneralisation, or causal claims that are not supported by the data.
-   Data minimisation – reporting only what is necessary to address the research questions.
-   Participant dignity – ensuring findings are presented respectfully, even when results are unexpected or negative.

If findings could be misinterpreted or cause distress, students should note how they will contextualise and explain results carefully. In the end, you need to show your **understanding** who will see your results, how they will be shared, and how you will protect participants from harm or identification when doing so.

## *3-7-Storage*

Your data should be **fully anonymised form** as this is best practice to protect your participants. Specifically, this is when the information does not relate to an identified or identifiable person or to personal data rendered anonymous in such a manner that the data subject is not or no longer identifiable.

Please avoid going for **identifiable** information as this will tagged as high risk and the wait time for your application will extend from 2 weeks.

## *3-8-Data Processing*

The anonymisation process should be applied as early as possible and maintained throughout the research lifecycle. Nevertheless, this will vary if you are using specific platforms or methodological approaches. Therefore, I have highlighted the following steps as good practice:

**Removal of direct identifiers** - All direct identifiers (e.g. names, email addresses, student numbers, IP addresses, or usernames) must be removed from the dataset immediately after data collection.

**Use of participant codes** - Each participant should be assigned a unique, non-identifiable code (e.g. P001, P002). Any document linking participant identities to codes (a “key”) must be stored separately from the research data, in a secure location, and accessed only if absolutely necessary.

**Handling of indirect identifiers** - Indirect identifiers (e.g. age, gender, ethnicity, job role, or other demographic variables) should be collected only where relevant and reported in aggregated form. Categories may be collapsed where small cell sizes could risk identification.

**Anonymisation of qualitative data** - For interviews, open-text responses, or observational notes, identifying details (e.g. names of people, places, organisations, or unique events) must be removed or replaced with neutral descriptors (e.g. “\[workplace\]”, “\[friend\]”).

**Secure storage of anonymised data -** Anonymised datasets should be stored on approved, secure systems (e.g.University OneDrive) with restricted access. Identifiable raw data should not be shared or transferred unnecessarily.

**Reporting and dissemination -** Findings must be reported in a way that prevents identification of individuals or small groups, including careful use of quotations, figures, and tables.

**Data retention and destruction -** Any temporary files containing identifiable information should be securely deleted once anonymisation is complete and no longer required.

## *3-9-Disclosure*

This should hopefully no. If there is a potential of disclosure please discuss with your supervisor to best manage how to limit confidentiality of the participants.

## *3-10-Data Transfer*

As your data should be maintained on the University Office 360 account then you should answer **No**.

# **4 - Governance**

## *4-1-Further Ethical Issues*

This should hopefully be a **no**. If **yes** please discuss with your supervisor asi this will vary type of psychometric scales to usage of deception in experiments.

## *4-2-Experience*

You should outline the core principles of the BPS here as have you been taught. Then outline the specific modules you have obtained this training. I would recommend to show as much information of your understanding and how it conects with the current research and how you have ensured to keep ethical standard throughout your application.

## *4-3-Conflicts of Interest*

This should hopefully be a **no**. If yes then please discuss with your supervisor.

## *4-4-Insurance*

Please outline any of the selected elements if your research does involve with any of the following from the list on Vidatum Academic.

## *4-5-Information Security*

This should hopefully be **None of the Above**.

# **5 - Attachments**

This section should comprise of the necessary documents that. For this section please try to add all the necessary documents:

- Advert
- Participant Information Sheet
- Consent Form
- Experimental Materials (if quantitative experiment)
- Psychometric Scales (If quantitative survey)
- Interview schedule (if qualitative interview)
