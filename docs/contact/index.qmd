If you need assistance with equipment, project support, training, or have requests regarding technical services, please contact us at:

## Guidance for Enquiries

-   **Students** – Please contact us as early as possible if you require technical support for third-year projects, dissertations, or research activities. Early discussions allow us to plan effectively and ensure you have the right equipment and training in place.

-   **Academic Staff** – We are available to support teaching, laboratory practicals, open days, and research projects. If your module or event requires technical input, please reach out in advance so we can coordinate.

-   **External Enquiries / Third Parties** – All requests relating to collaborations, equipment demonstrations, or technical support for external projects should also be directed to the email above. We will respond or redirect your enquiry as appropriate.

## Contacting Externally

For reasons of academic integrity and operational efficiency, we kindly ask that all external requests — whether for student projects, staff teaching support, or third-party collaborations — be directed to your relevant psychology technician team within your university. However, if you wish to use the resources from our university then please contact us so we can ensure any enquiries are handled promptly, consistently, and recorded appropriately to the relevant channels:
