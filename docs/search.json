    "text": "The Psychology Technicians at Wrexham University provide essential technical support, training, and expertise to staff and students in the Psychology Department.\nWe ensure that teaching, research, and student projects are supported with the right tools, equipment, and guidance.\n\n\n\nWe support the Psychology Department in three key areas:\n\nTeaching Support\nWe prepare, maintain, and run equipment for practical classes, workshops, and open days.\nFrom laboratory demonstrations to experimental psychology tasks, we ensure everything runs smoothly.\nResearch Support\nWe help staff and students set up studies, collect data, and manage specialist equipment.\nOur expertise covers Biopac, Tobii Eye Tracking, CANTAB, and software such as PsychoPy, R, and Gorilla.\nStudent Projects\nUndergraduate and postgraduate students rely on our guidance for dissertations, independent projects, and experiments.\nWe provide training, troubleshooting, and technical advice to make sure students can carry out their work confidently.\n\n\n\n\nWe’re always happy to support colleagues across the department and to collaborate on interdisciplinary projects. For undergraduate students, we strongly encourage you to discuss your third-year project ideas with us as early as possible. Many projects require careful planning, and we can often design experiments tailored to your specific needs. This may involve building bespoke solutions from scratch or identifying and adapting reliable “off-the-shelf” tools. Early conversations ensure we have the time to create a setup that works effectively and supports your research aims.\n\nJISC Survey development\nGorilla Experimental Framework\n3D modelling and animation (Blender)\n2D art and animation\nC# / C++ Coding within the Unity / Unreal Game Engine\nHTML web development, and CSS (including basic Quarto deployment )\nDigital photography and video recording\nVideo editing and post production (DaVinci Resolve)\nVirtual Reality\nSpecialist knowledge of the Biopac, Tobii Eye Tracker and EEG\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPsychology Technician\n\n\nSpecialist in data science, experimental design, and supporting advanced research methods. I provide technical expertise to help design, implement, and analyse complex experiments, ensuring robust and reproducible results. My work spans data management, statistical modelling, and the integration of open source tools and software to optimise research workflows. I collaborate closely with students and staff to translate research questions into practical study designs and actionable insights, supporting projects from conception through to final reporting\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPsychology Technician\n\n\nSpecialising in providing support with experimental queries, data collection setups, and guidance on managing data for assignments.
