Examples include:\n\nSchools or Colleges — Many schools require their own safeguarding and research approval before any contact with pupils or staff.\n\n\n\nNHS settings — Any research involving patients, staff, data, or premises within the NHS requires approval through the Health Research Authority (HRA).\n\n\n\nCharities, workplaces, or community organisations — If you intend to recruit participants or collect data through an external organisation, they may have internal research governance processes you must follow.\n\n\n\nPrivate companies or clinical services — Some services (e.g., counselling agencies, private clinics) require written permission or internal ethical review.\n\nIn short, a student needs External Approval whenever another organisation acts as a gatekeeper to participants, data, or locations, and that organisation insists on its own permission procedure."

Just be as pedantic as possible and try to give as much information out as possible so that the reviewer understand what you are trying to do. Sometimes being vague can be at your disadvantage as then the reviewer will question if there’s any ethical considerations you had left out in your application as data is important. S\nSpecifically to consider, you must highlight why you are collecting specific demographic data. As the are protected characteristics that must be protected unless past research demands it. Essentially, protected characteristics are personal identity attributes that require extra care in research because misuse or disclosure could cause harm, discrimination, or distress. Therefore, if you are trying to obtain specific demographics then please make sure to reference why it is necessary for your research to obtain these characteristics in alignment to your aims and objectives.\nA list of common protected characteristics relevant to psychological research:\n\nAge – Including children, adolescents, and older adults, who may require additional consent or capacity considerations.\nDisability – Physical, sensory, cognitive, or mental impairments; includes neurodiversity and mental health conditions.\nGender reassignment – Transgender and gender-diverse identities, including transition history.\nMarriage and civil partnership – Relevant when research concerns legal, social, or relational status.\nPregnancy and maternity – Including pregnancy status, postnatal experiences, or fertility-related issues.\nRace / ethnicity – Including nationality, skin colour, ethnic or cultural background.\nReligion or belief – Religious affiliation, spiritual beliefs, or lack of belief.\nSex – Typically referring to biological sex.\nSexual orientation – Sexual identity, attraction, or behaviour.\n\nEthics committees should and will often ask:\n\nIs this characteristic essential to the research aims?\nCould participants be identified or harmed if data were disclosed?\nAre recruitment, consent, and reporting respectful and inclusive?\n\nYou must clearly describe how your data will be collected or generated. In most cases, data should be collected using approved platforms such as JISC (for surveys), Gorilla.sc (for experimental tasks), Panopto (for interviews / focus groups). If you are collecting data in person without using a dedicated platform, you must outline a clear and structured procedure to ensure that data are collected consistently, handled securely, and stored appropriately on University One Drive.\nIf your study involves any paper-based materials, you must specify how these will be managed and securely disposed of, including prompt placement into confidential waste bins once data have been transferred or are no longer required. Careful consideration of these procedures is essential, as face-to-face data collection is subject to closer ethical scrutiny, particularly in relation to how participant data are handled, stored, and protected."

For most undergraduate and postgraduate projects, this will include:\nSubmission as part of a dissertation, thesis, or assessed coursework\nPresentation to academic staff or examiners\nPossible inclusion in poster presentations, internal conferences, or teaching materials\nIf there is any intention to share findings more widely (e.g. conferences, journal articles, public reports), this should be stated clearly. You should also indicate that results will be reported in an aggregated and anonymised form, rather than at an individual participant level.\nStudents are not expected to publish their work, but they should be clear and realistic about potential academic dissemination routes. If you seek to publish your work then please speak to your supervisor.\nSomething to note however, you should demonstrate awareness of how dissemination could affect participants or groups represented in the data. Key ethical considerations typically include:\n\nAnonymity and confidentiality – ensuring that no individual participant can be identified in written reports, presentations, or figures.\nSensitive or protected characteristics – taking care not to stigmatise, stereotype, or misrepresent individuals or groups, particularly where protected characteristics are involved.\nResponsible reporting – avoiding sensationalised language, overgeneralisation, or causal claims that are not supported by the data.\nData minimisation – reporting only what is necessary to address the research questions.\nParticipant dignity – ensuring findings are presented respectfully, even when results are unexpected or negative.\n\nIf findings could be misinterpreted or cause distress, students should note how they will contextualise and explain results carefully. In the end, you need to show your understanding who will see your results, how they will be shared, and how you will protect participants from harm or identification when doing so."

    "text": "3-8-Data Processing\nThe anonymisation process should be applied as early as possible and maintained throughout the research lifecycle. Nevertheless, this will vary if you are using specific platforms or methodological approaches. Therefore, I have highlighted the following steps as good practice:\nRemoval of direct identifiers - All direct identifiers (e.g. names, email addresses, student numbers, IP addresses, or usernames) must be removed from the dataset immediately after data collection.\nUse of participant codes - Each participant should be assigned a unique, non-identifiable code (e.g. P001, P002). Any document linking participant identities to codes (a “key”) must be stored separately from the research data, in a secure location, and accessed only if absolutely necessary.\nHandling of indirect identifiers - Indirect identifiers (e.g. age, gender, ethnicity, job role, or other demographic variables) should be collected only where relevant and reported in aggregated form. Categories may be collapsed where small cell sizes could risk identification.\nAnonymisation of qualitative data - For interviews, open-text responses, or observational notes, identifying details (e.g. names of people, places, organisations, or unique events) must be removed or replaced with neutral descriptors (e.g. “[workplace]”, “[friend]”).\nSecure storage of anonymised data - Anonymised datasets should be stored on approved, secure systems (e.g.University OneDrive) with restricted access. Identifiable raw data should not be shared or transferred unnecessarily.\nReporting and dissemination - Findings must be reported in a way that prevents identification of individuals or small groups, including careful use of quotations, figures, and tables.\nData retention and destruction - Any temporary files containing identifiable information should be securely deleted once anonymisation is complete and no longer required."

Sensitive topics may include, but are not limited to: trauma, abuse, violence, self-harm, suicide, substance use, discrimination, illegal behaviour, bereavement, sexual behaviour, or highly personal life experiences.\nResearch Ethics Committees assess sensitive-topic proposals with particular attention to participant vulnerability, likelihood of distress, and researcher preparedness. Students must demonstrate that they have anticipated potential emotional, psychological, or social risks and have put in place appropriate safeguards. This includes recognising that participants may have lived experience related to the topic, even if the study does not explicitly recruit clinical or vulnerable populations.\nEthical viability depends not only on what is being studied, but how it is studied. Question wording, task framing, sequencing of measures, and the context in which participation occurs all influence participant wellbeing. Studies that are overly intrusive, poorly justified, or disproportionate to the level of academic training are likely to be rejected or require substantial revision.\nStudents are expected to work closely with their supervisor when proposing sensitive topics and to engage in early ethical reflection rather than treating ethics as an administrative step. In many cases, Research Ethics Committees will expect explicit justification for why a sensitive topic is necessary, how harm will be minimised, and how participants will be supported both during and after participation.\nDo / Do Not Guidance:\n\n✅ Provide a clear theoretical and empirical justification for studying the sensitive topic\n✅ Demonstrate proportionality between research aims and participant burden\n✅ Include content warnings and remind participants of their right to skip questions\n✅ Implement robust debriefing and signposting procedures\n✅ Consult supervisors early and revise designs where risk is disproportionate\n❌ Include sensitive questions without strong justification\n❌ Use graphic, explicit, or unnecessarily detailed materials\n❌ Assume participants will not experience distress\n❌ Proceed without clear plans for managing adverse reactions\n\nSensitive-topic research can be ethically appropriate and academically valuable when designed with care, reflexivity, and proportional safeguards. Students must show the REC that participant welfare, feasibility, and institutional responsibility have been prioritised at every stage of the research process.\nDo / Do Not Guidance:\n\n✅ Justify and manage sensitive topics carefully\n✅ Consult supervisors\n❌ Use sensitive topics without safeguards\n❌ Assume participants can cope without support\n\n\n\n\nResearch focusing on mental health and wellbeing is common in psychology but carries heightened ethical responsibility, particularly in student research contexts. While such topics are not prohibited, Research Ethics Committees closely scrutinise how constructs are defined, measured, and communicated to participants. Students must be especially careful to distinguish between research-oriented measurement and any form of clinical assessment or diagnosis.\nUndergraduate and postgraduate taught students are not qualified clinicians, and therefore must not design studies that imply diagnosis, screening, or evaluation of mental disorders. Even widely used instruments (e.g., depression, anxiety, stress scales) must be framed explicitly as self-report research measures assessing experiences or traits, not as tools for identifying clinical conditions.\nMental health research also increases the likelihood of participant distress. As such, ethics applications must demonstrate clear risk mitigation strategies, including advance warnings, the right to skip questions, withdrawal without penalty, and robust debriefing procedures. Appropriate support signposting (e.g., NHS, GP, university wellbeing services, crisis lines) must be included and tailored to the nature of the topic.\nStudents should also consider the cumulative burden of questions, especially when combining multiple mental health measures or sensitive topics. RECs may reject studies that appear overly intrusive, excessive, or poorly justified relative to the research question.\nDo / Do Not Guidance:\n\n✅ Use non-diagnostic, research-appropriate self-report measures\n✅ Clearly state that measures are not providing clinical assessment or diagnosis\n✅ Provide clear content warnings and the option to skip questions\n✅ Include tailored support and wellbeing signposting in debrief materials\n✅ Justify the number and type of mental health measures used\n❌ Attempt to diagnose, screen, or label participants\n❌ Present scores as indicators of mental disorder or clinical risk\n❌ Use mental health measures without a clear theoretical rationale\n❌ Omit support information when researching distress-related topics\n\nWhen designed carefully, mental health and wellbeing research can be ethically sound and scientifically valuable. However, students must demonstrate to the REC that participant welfare, scope of competence, and proportionality of risk have been prioritised throughout the study design.\nDo / Do Not Guidance:\n\n✅ Use non-diagnostic, research-appropriate measures\n✅ Provide support signposting\n❌ Attempt to diagnose or label participants\n❌ Use measures implying clinical evaluation\n\n\n\n\nResearch involving children and young people under the age of 18 is subject to significantly heightened ethical, legal, and safeguarding requirements. Such participants are legally classified as a vulnerable population, meaning that Research Ethics Committees apply a much higher threshold when evaluating risk, consent, feasibility, and institutional responsibility.\nFor undergraduate psychology students, primary data collection with under-18s is generally not permitted within standard dissertation timelines. This is due to multiple practical and ethical constraints, including the requirement for enhanced safeguarding procedures, parental or guardian consent, school or institutional gatekeeper approval, and, in many cases, a Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) check. Collectively, these processes typically exceed the duration of an academic year and cannot be guaranteed within undergraduate project timeframes.\nEducational settings (e.g., schools, colleges, youth services) also impose their own ethics review processes and calendars, which operate independently of university RECs. Even where a research idea is ethically sound in principle, delays or refusals at the institutional level may render the project unviable.\nStudents who are strongly interested in educational or developmental psychology must therefore treat under-18 research as a long-term academic goal, more appropriate for postgraduate or doctoral study. Any such interest must be communicated to academic staff at least one year in advance, and only in collaboration with a member of the Psychology Department who has existing expertise, contacts, and safeguarding clearance in educational research.\nCrucially, all students proposing research that might involve under-18s must prepare a fully independent backup project using adult participants. This backup must be capable of standing alone as the primary dissertation project in the event that ethics approval, school access, or DBS clearance is not obtained.\nDo / Do Not Guidance:\n\n✅ Inform academic staff at least one year in advance of any intention to work with under-18s\n✅ Expect under-18 research to be more appropriate for postgraduate-level study\n✅ Prepare a complete adult-participant backup project from the outset\n✅ Consider alternative approaches (e.g., adult educators, trainee teachers, parents, or retrospective self-report designs)\n❌ Attempt to recruit children or young people without full REC, parental, and institutional approval\n❌ Assume DBS checks and school permissions can be completed within one academic year\n❌ Design a dissertation that depends solely on under-18 access\n\nThis approach protects children and young people, ensures compliance with safeguarding obligations, and prevents students from jeopardising degree progression due to delays or denied ethical approval.\nDo / Do Not Guidance:\n\n✅ Notify academic staff at least one year in advance, more appropriate for postgraduate study.\n✅ Develop a fully viable adult-participant backup project\n❌ Attempt research with under-18s without approvals\n❌ Assume school and DBS processes can be completed in one academic year\n\n\n\n\nResearch in forensic settings (e.g., prisons, probation services, secure hospitals, or with justice-involved populations) presents substantial ethical, legal, and institutional challenges. Such research is considered high-risk due to heightened vulnerability, power imbalances, restricted autonomy, and institutional gatekeeping. As a result, undergraduate students are generally not permitted to conduct primary research within prisons or secure forensic environments.\nKey barriers include the need for multi-layered ethical approval (university REC, HM Prison and Probation Service or equivalent bodies), enhanced safeguarding procedures, security clearance, and extended timelines that far exceed a standard academic year. Participants in these settings may also experience constrained freedom to consent, raising serious concerns about voluntariness and coercion.\nDo / Do Not Guidance:\n\n✅ Notify academic staff at least one year in advance if interested in forensic research\n✅ Expect this type of research to be more appropriate for postgraduate or doctoral study\n✅ Develop a fully viable backup project using non-forensic adult populations\n✅ Frame forensic interests through theoretical, survey-based, or analogue designs where appropriate\n❌ Attempt to access prisons, probation services, or secure units independently\n❌ Recruit justice-involved participants without formal institutional agreements\n❌ Assume consent is freely given in custodial or mandated contexts\n❌ Underestimate timelines, safeguarding, and legal requirements\n\nStudents with an interest in forensic psychology are strongly encouraged to explore non-institutional samples and ethically appropriate analogue methods (e.g., vignettes, mock juror studies) that involve primary data collection, allowing forensic concepts to be examined without exposing participants, researchers, or the university to undue risk. Publicly available datasets are not appropriate for dissertation projects where primary data collection is a core requirement.\n\n\n\n\nThis section will contain slightly more comprehensive information so that student’s is fully informed and well guided to reach specific goals for their Dissertation project. \nQuantitative \n\nSurveys \n\nDecide upon research question \nFind the appropriate templates that can be found on Link[https://wrexham.ac.uk/research/our-research/research-ethics/how-to-apply–university-templates/]\nDecide the statistical model that will fit the research question. \n\ni.e. Correlation, Linear Regression, Poisson, Zero Inflated Count Models etc. \n\nYour participant information sheet should be the first document shown to your participant unless you are asking if they are going to read the Welsh versions.
