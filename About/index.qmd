# About the Psychology Technicians

The Psychology Technicians at Wrexham University provide essential technical support, training, and expertise to staff and students in the Psychology Department.\
We ensure that teaching, research, and student projects are supported with the right tools, equipment, and guidance.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Our Role

We support the Psychology Department in three key areas:

-   **Teaching Support**\
    We prepare, maintain, and run equipment for practical classes, workshops, and open days.\
    From laboratory demonstrations to experimental psychology tasks, we ensure everything runs smoothly.

-   **Research Support**\
    We help staff and students set up studies, collect data, and manage specialist equipment.\
    Our expertise covers Biopac, EEG, Tobii Eye Tracking, CANTAB, and software such as PsychoPy, R, and Gorilla.

-   **Student Projects**\
    Undergraduate and postgraduate students rely on our guidance for dissertations, independent projects, and experiments.\
    We provide training, troubleshooting, and technical advice to make sure students can carry out their work confidently.

## Technical Expertise

I’m always happy to support colleagues across the department and to collaborate on interdisciplinary projects. For undergraduate students, I strongly encourage you to discuss your third-year project ideas with me as early as possible. Many projects require careful planning, and I can often design experiments tailored to your specific needs. This may involve building bespoke solutions from scratch or identifying and adapting reliable “off-the-shelf” tools. Early conversations ensure we have the time to create a setup that works effectively and supports your research aims.
